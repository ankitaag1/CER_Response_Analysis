# CER_Response_Analysis
This repository contains the code for the analysis done in the NSF poster 'How do Students Express their Claim-Evidence-Reasoning on Scenario-based Assessments Grounded in Real-World Issues?' https://cadrek12.org/sites/default/files/SciEd%20Poster%20FINAL_NSF_AL%281%29.pptx

The 'CER_reasoning.csv' consists of responses by school students within the 'Text' column about scenario-based response of claim-evidence reasoning (CER).

The code can be used to preprocess the text within these columns and generate the word clouds with unigrams and bigrams within the responses.
